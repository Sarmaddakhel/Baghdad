            <p class="speach">Baghdad, a city whose history is as magnificent as it is tragic. Founded in 762 AD, Baghdad quickly rose to become a beacon of knowledge, culture, and innovation during the Islamic Golden Age. Scholars from all over the world flocked to its libraries and institutions, contributing to advancements in science, literature, and philosophy.

                However, this city of brilliance has also endured profound suffering. The Mongol invasion of 1258 brought unparalleled destruction, decimating its population and annihilating its libraries. In modern times, Baghdad has faced the horrors of wars, sanctions, and ongoing conflicts, leaving deep scars on its infrastructure and psyche. The Iran-Iraq War, the Gulf War, and the invasion of 2003 inflicted immense pain and displacement upon its people.
                
                Despite these challenges, the spirit of Baghdad's citizens remains unbroken. They continue to rebuild, drawing strength from their rich heritage and vibrant culture. Baghdad's story is one of resilience, a testament to the enduring human spirit that rises even in the face of adversity. As we honor this city's storied past, let us also commit to supporting its future, envisioning a Baghdad that can once again shine as a symbol of hope, unity, and enduring greatness.
